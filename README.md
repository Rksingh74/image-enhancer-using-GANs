Image Enhancement using SRGAN
Project Overview ðŸ“·
This project enhances low-resolution images using a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) model. The tool applies SRGAN to generate high-quality images, with additional options for sharpness adjustment and noise reduction. The entire application is built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

Features ðŸš€
Upload low-resolution images (supports .jpg, .jpeg, .png).
Automatically enhances image resolution using a pre-trained SRGAN model.
Sharpness Adjustment: Fine-tune sharpness levels for the enhanced image.
Noise Reduction: Reduce noise using Gaussian blur filters.
View side-by-side comparison of input, enhanced, and final images.
Download the Enhanced Image and Final Image.
